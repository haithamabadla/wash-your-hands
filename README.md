# Nothing new, wash your hands!

Dr. Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis was a Hungarian physician and scientist, now known as an early pioneer of antiseptic procedures. Described as the "saviour of mothers", Semmelweis discovered that the incidence of puerperal fever could be drastically cut by the use of hand disinfection in obstetrical clinics.

Dr. Semmelweis suspected that the 10% of women dying from childbirth was related to improper antiseptic procedures in the delivery room. He introduced new handwashing procedure using chlorinated lime solutions, which reduced the mortality rate of women in labor and giving him a slogon "Saviour of Mothers".
